📝 Notebook App - Personal Data Management Project

A lightweight Full-stack Web Application built with Flask and SQLite to manage personal notes and more. This is my very first personal project as an Information Technology student specializing in Data Technology.

🚀 Overview
This project allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes (CRUD operations) through a clean, responsive web interface. It is designed to be a "lab" where I apply my knowledge of Python, Databases, and Frontend design.
