## 🚀 Overview
This project serves as a "coding lab" where I apply my knowledge of Python, Databases, and Frontend design. It allows users to manage notes through a clean, highly personalized interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask Framework)
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy (ORM)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), and Vanilla JavaScript

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data and preferences are stored locally and securely.

## 📈 Future Roadmaps (Phase 2)
As a **Data Technology** major, I plan to integrate:
1. **Data Analytics**: Use **Pandas** to analyze note-taking frequency and productivity.
2. **Visualization**: Implement charts to compare monthly activity.
3. **Smart Features**: Task checklists and automated reminders.
