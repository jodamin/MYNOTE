## 🚀 Overview
This project serves as a "coding lab" where I apply my knowledge of Python, Databases, and Frontend design. It allows users to manage notes through a clean, highly personalized interface.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask Framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Cloud hosted on Render) / SQLite (Local development)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism), and Vanilla JavaScript
- **Environment**: Windows 10/ 11

## ✨ Key Features
- **Full CRUD**: Seamlessly add, read, edit, and remove notes.
- **Customization**: Change backgrounds and toggle between Dark/Light modes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile

## 📈 Future Roadmaps
As a **Data Technology** major, I plan to integrate:
1. **Data Analytics**: Use **Pandas** to analyze note-taking frequency and productivity.
2. **Visualization**: Implement charts to compare monthly activity.
